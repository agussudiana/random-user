![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7523159/178709860-bfc4fc5b-af25-4d6d-8eb4-9a29a6fbeb92.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How To Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\


## Background

This personal project is about to fecth random data user and display it into the table. There are several feature that implemented at this project
- Debounce Search ‚û°Ô∏è User are able to search data by the keyword that inputed through the text field. When user typing any keyword, it will give delay for `1 second` before hit the API. This function is called debounce process.
- Filter by gender ‚û°Ô∏è User are able to filter the data based on gender that selected on select box gender.
- Reset Filter ‚û°Ô∏è User are able reset all the filtered data and back to the default state.
- Pagination ‚û°Ô∏è User will see the pagination button at the bottom of the table, it means the table will display 10 data per page for each request.
- Sort by Column ‚û°Ô∏è User are able to sort the data by clicking the header column. It can be sorted ascending or descending.

## UI KIT üëï

This project application is using UI KIT from React Material UI https://mui.com/

## Data Fetching

This project using random data user that provided by https://randomuser.me/. To fetch the API, we are utilize a react hook library called `SWR`

### Why SWR? üöÄ
The name ‚ÄúSWR‚Äù is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data. With SWR, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and automatically.
And the UI will be always fast and reactive.

## History Changes

This project contains some features that developed one by one.
Each feature will be merged through the raised PR and automatically deployed to the Vercel.
